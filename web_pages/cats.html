          <strong class="sub_head">About:</strong><br />
          Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia
          region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the
          United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds,
          care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
          practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy
          family member regardless of breed.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="sub_head">Zero to Four Weeks: </strong> <br />
          It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that
          is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible.
          Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
          progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient
          rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a
          bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might
          <em> might not</em> gain weight appropriately include the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
          <li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
          <li>Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold</li>
          <li>Unsanitary conditions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <strong class="sub_head">Four Weeks to One Year: </strong> <br />
          Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
          around three to four weeks after birth. <br /><br />
          According to the
          <a href="https://www.aspca.org/" target="_blank">ASPCA</a>
          kittens at this age should eat either:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Half to one cup of dry kitten food</li>
          <em>OR</em>
          <li>Six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day.</li>
        </ul>
        If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of
        water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for
        kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth,
        energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have
        different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your
        veterinarian for recommendations. <br />
        <br />

        <strong class="sub_head">One Year to Seven Years: </strong> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do
            <em>not</em> need as many nutrients.
          </li>
          <li>
            At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so does their
            metabolism.
          </li>

          <li>
            It is <em>not</em> recommended to leave food out for the cats all
            day.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Instead, provide food a couple of times a day so they eat meals rather
        than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of
        obesity and other weight-related feline ailments. <br /><br />

        <strong class="sub_head"> Seven Years and More:</strong> <br />
        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
        experience a lot of changes. <br /><br />

        Cats at this age should eat:
        <ul>
          <li>Less fat and calories</li>
          <li>More quality proteins.</li>
        </ul>

        This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for
        food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a
        category (such as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or
        combinations, of lesser-quality proteins. <br /><br />

      The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse
      variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by the
      World Canine Organization. =
      <br />
      <br />

      <strong class="sub_head">Adoption Benefits</strong><br />
      Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits between dog and owner. Many studies
      cite the social benefits of having a companion as well as the reduced
      feelings of loneliness from adopting a dog. Studies even show
      <a
        href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554"
        target="_blank"

        medical indicators such as reduced blood pressure and improved lipid
        profiles.
      </a>
      <br /><br />

      If you have a dog, it is important to:
      <ul>
        <li>Care for your dog</li>
        <li>Be mindful of what you feed your dog</li>
        <li>Provide enough opportunities for exercise</li>
      </ul>

      In this page, you will find more information about how to care for your
      pets throughout the various stages of their lives.

      <br /><br />

      <strong class="sub_head">Diet & Exercise</strong> <br />
      Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals as
      they mature.
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Puppies:</strong> nursed for the first two months</li>
        <li>
          <strong> Three to six months years old:</strong> three meals per day
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Six months to one year old:</strong> reduced to two meals per
          day
        </li>
        <li><strong>One year old: </strong>reduced to one meal</li>
      </ul>

      A dog’s typical body mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70
      percent water. <br />

      The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/" target="_blank">ASPCA</a> says:
      <ul>
        <li>10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness</li>
        <li>15 percent loss can cause death</li>
      </ul>

      <em>Make sure you keep your pooch hydrated!</em>

      <br /><br />

      Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of activity to keep
      their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air. The minimum
      recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed and size
      differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of exercise is
      recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two hours per day? OK, I
      know that wouldn't bother some of you reading this. But the thought of it
      to me makes me cringe! And exercising your dog does not mean you are being
      challenged to a push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also
      choose from a variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure
      they are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful
      attention to toys that require supervision.

      <br /><br />

      <strong class="sub_head">Grooming & Handling:</strong> <br />
      Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health.
      <br /><br />

      Be sure to:
      <ul>
        <li>Brush frequently (reduces shedding & difficult tangled fur)</li>
        <li>
          Check for insects such as ticks and fleas (especially after visiting
          heavily wooded areas.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      Bathing:
      <ul>
        <li>Rinse all the soap out (residual soap can cause rash)</li>
        <li>
          Use soap formulated for your puppy or dog (avoid allergic reactions)
        </li>
        <li>Be careful how you handle your loved one:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Small dog: cradle with one hand under the chest and the forearm
            supporting the back half.
          </li>
          <li>
            Large dog: reach under the belly with both your arms perpendicular
            to the dog, and use each arm to support the chest and rear as you
            lift
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <strong class="sub_head"> Vaccinations & Medications</strong><br />
      You should always consult with your veterinarian, but there is a core set
      of
      <a
        href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet"
        target="_blank"
      >
        vaccines
      </a>
      that are typically recommended. <br /><br />

      Vaccines reduce the risk of exposure to:
      <ul>
        <li>Hepatitis</li>
        <li>Rabies</li>
        <li>Parvovirus</li>
        <li>Bordetella</li>
        <li>Bronchiectasis</li>
        <li>Borrelia burgdorferi</li>
        <li>Leptospira bacteria</li>
      </ul>
